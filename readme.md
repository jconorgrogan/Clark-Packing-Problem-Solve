Hexagonal Packing: In a hexagonal arrangement, the six outer circles touch the central one and two other circles, guaranteeing non-overlapping.

String Utilization: Each of the 6 circles uses

L.

Your conclusion about hexagonal packing being the optimal solution aligns with the mathematical principle of "Circle Packing in a Circle," where hexagonal packing is the most efficient way to pack circles within a larger circle.

To generalize, consider 
�
n circles packed hexagonally in a circle. The outer 
�
−
1
n−1 circles touch the central circle. The string length 
�
L must satisfy:

�
=
�
×
�
L=n×C
For 
�
n circles, the circumference 
�
C should be 
�
�
n
L
​
 , and the radius 
�
r can be calculated similarly. The general formula for radius in terms of 
�
L and 
�
n is:

�
=
�
2
�
�
r= 
2πn
L
​
 
This framework can be extended to other packing problems involving more or fewer circles, provided 
�
L and 
�
n are compatible to ensure no leftover string.
