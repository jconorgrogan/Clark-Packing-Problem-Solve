For a circle with radius ( R ) and ( n ) equally spaced nodes, the task is to find the values of ( n ) that allow the distance ( D ) between adjacent nodes to fit an integer number of times across the diameter of the circle. The distance ( D ) between adjacent nodes is given by:

[ D = 2R \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right) ]

Conclusion: The instances where the distance ( D ) between nodes fits as an integer multiple across the diameter of the circle are:

( n = 2 ): The distance ( D ) fits exactly 1 time across the diameter, dividing the circle into two equal parts.
( n = 6 ): The distance ( D ) fits exactly 2 times across the diameter, dividing the circle into six equal parts.
( n = \infty ): A more abstract concept, where the distance ( D ) fits an infinite number of times across the diameter, representing a continuum or infinite division.
The condition we're looking for is when the distance ( D ) between nodes fits as an integer multiple across the diameter. We have:

[ D = 2R \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right) \times k = 2R ]

Simplifying, we get:

[ \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right) = \frac{1}{k} ]

The sine function has a range between -1 and 1, so the only integer values of ( k ) that would make the equation valid are 1 and 2.

For ( k = 1 ), we get ( \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right) = 1 ), which leads to ( n = 2 ).
For ( k = 2 ), we get ( \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right) = \frac{1}{2} ), which leads to ( n = 6 ).
No other integer values for ( k ) will satisfy the equation, hence these are the only integer solutions for ( n ), besides the limit case of ( n = \infty ).

You can go even further. Imagine instead of equidisdant nodes as chords you just have a set length of each node. Now, imagine you want to maintain that length from the opposite end. in other words, you have to maintain distance away. but you can bend the dimension you want. Something interesting happends at exactly this n=6/R= ratio of x. You can maintain length in different dimensions, and have no leftovers/modolo.

The String Universe-Circle Theorem
Definitions and Notations
Let ( \mathcal{U} ) be a one-dimensional string of infinite length.
Let ( R ) be a positive real number representing the radius of a circle.
Define ( D ) as a segment length in ( \mathcal{U} ).
Let ( k ) be an integer, and let ( 2R ) be partitioned into ( k ) equidistant segments each of length ( D ) such that ( k \cdot D = 2R ).
Let ( n ) be the number of such segments ( D ) that are chords of the circle with radius ( R ).
Theorem
For a circle to emerge from the partitioning of ( \mathcal{U} ) in the manner described, ( n ) must be ( 2 ), ( 6 ), or ( \infty ).

Conditions
For ( n = 2 ): ( D = 2R ) and ( k = 1 ).
For ( n = 6 ): ( D = R ) and ( k = 2 ), corresponding to the inscribed hexagon.
For ( n = \infty ): ( D = 0 ) and ( k = \infty ).
Interpretation
The circle's unique properties of uniformity and symmetry are emergent phenomena arising from the specific geometric arrangement of equidistant segments within ( \mathcal{U} ), satisfying ( k \cdot D = 2R ) for ( n = 2, 6, \text{ or } \infty ).

Your conclusion about hexagonal packing being the optimal solution aligns with the mathematical principle of "Circle Packing in a Circle," where hexagonal packing is the most efficient way to pack circles within a larger circle.

To generalize, consider
